## Course Goals/Objectives
- Build a MCP Tool to use with Github Copilot, and eventually with Copilot Studio Agents
- Start off simple
- Using Python to query the GitHub API

## Reasoning 
- I want to create an agent that can query other repos, specifially the readme files of those repos to understand the purpose of the repo is, and see some examples of how to use the repo, and may be even some examples of how to use the repo with Copilot Studio Agents.


## Step actions at a high level
1. Create some Python code to query the GitHub API
2. Test the code
3. Create an azure function to host the python code to query the GitHub API
4. Use the Snippy Azure FUnction example to add MCP to the Azure Function.
5. Deploy the azure Function and test with local GitHub Copilot - mcp.json
6. Try to integrate with Copilot Studio Agents
7. Refine the MCP tool based on feedback and testing
